#Project Overview

The Expense Tracker Salesforce App is a robust solution designed to simplify and automate the management of employee and business expenses. It replaces manual, error-prone processes with a streamlined workflow, enabling employees and finance teams to track, approve, and analyze expenses efficiently.

Intuitive User Interface: Custom Lightning Web Components (LWC) provide a clean, modern interface for submitting expenses, viewing statuses, and generating reports.

Data-Driven Insights: All expense data is stored in Salesforce, enabling real-time reporting and analytics to help management monitor spending patterns and make informed decisions.

#Technologies Used

Salesforce Platform: The foundation for building the expense management application.

Salesforce Flow: Low-code automation to manage expense approvals, notifications, and status updates.
